        Prank apps
    </h1>
    <div class="page-description">
        Business first, pleasure afterwards. But why can’t we mix them? Making fun of your friends is a great way of
        entertainment. Besides, now with different hilarious prank apps, we can also earn some extra penny. We decided
        to check whether it is true and held our own investigation to make sure that prank application development will
        bring the same dividends as any other app (or even more!)

            What are they, why are they popular
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            First of all, let’s take a look at these applications and understand should we start the development or
            not.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            How often do your family and friends complain about boredom? Frankly speaking I hear such complaints nearly
            every day and of course, as a decent family member and a friend, I feel that I need to entertain them or
            just cheer up. I don’t even want to think how many evenings it would take me to go to the cinema with each
            weeper. For these purposes, I have a few prank applications on my phone which allow me to lift the mood of
            my lovely weepers within a few seconds.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The variety of these applications helps choose the most appropriate variant to make someone smile (at first
            they get angry with me and then smile). Some pranks are harmless and some are really mean. Which means you
            can choose a joke for each person whether they are very sensitive or pachyderm. Usually, after such a trick
            people usually want to know what app I used and download them too.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            And trust me, I’m not the only one who adores prank apps. For instance, Fake-A-Call Free app has more than
            1 mln downloads, Voice changer with effects was installed by more than 50 mln users, just like Fake GPS GO
            Location Spoofer Free that was installed by almost the same number of customers. The numbers show that such
            applications are extremely popular and they are not going to climb down.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Humour is the thing that will never get obsolescent. It gives us a range of benefits if we want to create a
            prank app. Besides, prank app development doesn’t mean that you cannot apply all modern technologies and
            approaches to make a great product. It is vice versa, the more modern features you add, the better your app
            would be.

            Best examples
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            As I’ve already mentioned, there are lots of pranks and prank apps. They are not only about calling someone
            changing the intonation and tone of your voice. I suggest making a short review of the most interesting and
            the most popular prank applications. Maybe some of them could inspire us to create something similar or
            even better.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Dude, your car (my favorite) is an app which uses photo editing tools to “damage” a vehicle. All you have
            to do is to take a picture of your friend/colleague/family member’s vehicle and add one of the multiple
            effects, like fire, smoke, a police officer and so on.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The choice of effects is really wide so you will never get bored with it. When you applying the effects,
            you have to spend some time to make them look real, but your friend’s reaction is a great reward for the
            efforts.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Voice changer. It is an app that changes your voice during a call. Firstly, you select an effect you want
            to apply to your voice and dial your friend after that. Acho, helium, mosquito, robot, Blane, turtle, choir
            are just a few options which you have in this app.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The application doesn’t allow you to make calls. You can only make a record and change it with the help of
            different effects. Anyway, the app is really fun and can be a great way to entertain your guests during the
            party. Or, you can send the audio message to a friend. If the variety isn’t enough for the users, they can
            pay for more and get other fantastic effects.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Fake-call. With this app, you can trick your friends, who will be sure that you are talking with the
            President of the United States or Lady Gaga. The other great feature of this product is that you can choose
            the time when a “celebrity” will dial you.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The app has 18 options of male and female voices to persuade people around you that you are talking to a
            real person (not to yourself). The app is free. There is a paid version for those who want to get an app
            without ads. You can also buy some new voices or record someone else's for some extra fee.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Crack Your Screen. This is so funny! The app imitates various crack effects on the phone screen. The prank
            works great if you have access to your friend’s or family member’s phone. You need to install the app on
            the smartphone of a person you want to make laugh at and turn it on. A person unblocks the screen, touches
            it and it “cracks”. You should see their eyes. It’s a real panic.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The app has three modes, the effect appears after a touch, after a shake or you can set a timer and the
            effects will be seen after a particular period of time.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            This joke is rather mean, so we wouldn't recommend you to use it with some middle-aged people or some very
            sensitive friends.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Fake GPS Location. This is for Instagram and Twitter fans. If you like to share your location on social
            media, then you would love this app. After you have installed the app, choose any country you like. That’s
            all!
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Imagine, your mum is calling you and asking where are you now and you send here your GPS location, let’s
            say, somewhere near the Everest. Or, you are on vacation (in Kentucky) but your Twitter shows that you are
            on the Bahamas.

            Our own experience
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            As for us, we are not an exception and have something to show you. Here is our own mobile application to
            make fun of your friends. It is called Prank Dial and we have it for iOS platform and for Android platform.

        <div class="paragraph">
            To make fun of somebody you need to pick a joke you like the most, here you can find about 200 hilarious
            scenarios like “you hit my car” or “Donald Trump calling”. Select a phone number of a person you want to
            get back at and send the prank dial. Listen to the dialogue and share it with your friends. The program
            adapts to the conversationalist, so it knows when to speak and when not.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            In the free version of the app, a user can send 3 free calls a day. Users also can comment their favorite
            pranks. A person can also listen to someone’s prank because the reactions are recorded and stored.

            Monetization strategies
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            These applications are really hilarious and if you add some nice features, you’ll get an army of loyal
            fans. But what’s next? How to make an app make money for you? Here are some great ideas how you can
            monetize your app and become a little bit richer (or far richer).
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Paid application. It's not necessary to make your application free. It can cost a dollar or $1,99 or 5 or
            ten bucks. Paid applications are very popular as well and even the fact that the market has some free
            competitors doesn’t mean that no one would buy your application. That's not true. Of course, a free app has
            more chances to be installed but it will bring less money than the paid one. If you think that a small fee
            for your app is ok, then you have to think through a few issues.
        </div>
        <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li>
                First of all, your has to offer really nice features to make the customers interested. If your
                application will offer nothing new and there are many similar free apps, then you’ve got a problem.
            </li>
            <li>
                Second of all, paid apps are preferable for iOS platform, because this audience is used to paying for
                services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Third of all, you need to work hard on the marketing strategy of your app and advertise it in such a
                way that everyone would fancy it before the release.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="paragraph">
            In-app-purchase. Is probably one of the most popular ways to monetize prank apps. In such a case, some
            features should be free and some (the most interesting ones) could be paid. Here is a pitfall you need to
            overcome. The free functionality has to be interesting and funny as well as paid features. If the most
            interesting things would be free then why would customers pay?
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Freemium. It’s a great model to make money with your application. But here goes the same issue as with
            in-app-purchase. If free version is dull it will be deleted and no one cares that the greatest and the
            funniest pranks are in the premium account. And vice versa, if the most interesting part is free users
            would not see the point to pay for premium account.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Advertisements. You can make your app absolutely free for users (they would appreciate it) adding some
            pop-ups or banners. Modern customers don’t actually notice these ads because they are everywhere, so we
            tend to ignore them. At the same time, it is a great way to monetize your app, not at users’ expense. It
            would be great if these apps are close to the context of your app or they advertise similar applications.
            In such a case, your users would not be very annoyed with it.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Subscription. To offer this monetization strategy to your users you have to be (brave) sure that your app
            is worth it. It has to be not only unique and super interesting application but something more. You will
            need to work hard and supply users with new functionality with each update. Frankly speaking, subscription
            works well only if the context of an application updates all the time and users know that they would get
            something fresh and great each month or so.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            From our own experience, we can tell you that the customers who order a prank application development are
            the rare guests nowadays. Product Owners are afraid of such applications because they don’t know how
            popular they are and how to monetize them. We hope that our article will persuade that prank apps are not
            worse than the others and can bring even more revenue than the delivery or streaming applications. If you
            want to create not only profitable application but also a very funny one, write us and let’s do that
            together!
