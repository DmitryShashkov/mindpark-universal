        To get an as structured insight as possible, let’s divide the post-Brexit concerns into three integral components and analyze them in terms of possible threats and opportunities:

            Financial and economic component
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            To begin with, pound sterling went into a nosedive just overnight after the voting for Brexit. And forecasts, unfortunately, are unpromising. Experts predict that by the end of the leaving process, the pound will lose up to 30 percent. This is going to affect business and not only the one connected with import / export.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The future of the City – the heart of the European financial and banking ecosystem, is rather vague. What financial markets hate most is the uncertainty such life-changing decisions as Brexit cause.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            London’s impeccable reputation as a hub of international trade and banking is at stake. Hence, if the UK miss the primacy in the fintech area, Germany will take its chance to replace it given that in 2015 Berlin was finally able to surpass London on the total volume of financial transactions involving startups.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Today, London is one of the main centers of European ecosystem of startups, but the British escape from the EU can dramatically change the situation, say market players. However, to a greater extent namely British startups will feel the impact of Brexit. And it’s all about investments. Many experts worry that the UK is unlikely to see investments in the coming months.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Taking into the tax benefits the UK ensures, some investors say they are willing to continue to invest in British startups, although this activity will be temporarily delayed. Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures, London-based venture capital firm, claims that it will be difficult for startups looking for investors, but to a lesser extent, this will affect startups in the early stages of development. However, if tax changes do take place (we, unfortunately, don’t know which exactly), the positive predictions may turn into negative.

        <h2 class="section-title">
            But in general, as startups are focused on the global market, and are not linked to the local economy, all the concerns may be exaggerated.
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Anyway, startup community outside the UK has also to face the commonwealth truth: there is no abstract European startup market; there are many separate markets of Germany, Britain, France, etc. It’s a very fragmented environment with separate urban ecosystems, different languages, and different problems.

            Legal regulations: process of extraction and subsequent legal details
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            It’s the first since the foundation of the European Union when countries have to actually negotiate the exit. To start the legal process of extraction engine, the UK must invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Following the rules that have never been tested for real, the withdrawing process is predicted to last until 2018. So, for that time business executives and decision-makers will have to learn how to “navigate through the fog”.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The UK economy is the world’s fifth largest economy, which makes the EU jointly the second globally largest, just behind the United States. That makes Britain’s exit an enormous project. Volumes of laws that touch every piece of economy will have to be rewritten: banking system, international trade, investment, immigration, businesses of various sizes, technology, so on and so forth.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            As a member of the European Union, any technology business in the UK, relatively speaking, he had a "passport", which allows working throughout the European Economic Area. The opposite is also true, by the way. Brexit may limit the freedom of former entrepreneurs operating on the EEA markets.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            There is also the issue of data regulation and its unimpeded flow across the borders.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The British voting will definitely affect the balance of power in a protracted confrontation between the European institutions and US technology corporations on the issue of dealing with the user data in Europe.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Currently, multinationals and tech firms from the United states (the most vivid example is Google) run out of ways to process the data of EU citizens legally, as the Safe Harbor agreement has fallen. In 2018 in the EU a new tough law on privacy, known as Privacy Shield deal comes into force. The much-vaunted replacement is supposed to ensure Europeans have adequate data-protection rights when US companies import their personal data. The main initiators of the maximum tightening of the rules in this area were Germany and France. Great Britain, on the contrary, advocated softer measures, to some extent, lobbying the interests of the overseas giants. Brexit, of course, strengthens the position of "radicals" and weakens the cards of American corporations.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            In addition, the UK itself can be at a risk to feel the grip of regulators from the EU. If the UK refuses to accept the same law, European companies will not be able to store their clients' personal data in this country.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Labor market major concerns
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Labor laws affecting freedom of movement of labor will also go through the changes. What companies are going to be affected? Well, obviously technology companies located in the UK and attracting developers from other EU countries. But that's not all. European companies with employees working from the UK.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Of course, it’s hard to predict whether the change of visa regime for residents and non-residents of the European Union will occur and to what and extent as everything will depend on negotiations between the UK and the EU. However, the businesses that rely on foreign workers or have main offices in the UK will have hard times in planning ahead.

            Can Brexit uncertainty create opportunity?
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            We tend to look for an opportunity in any unexpected or fairly predictable outcome. There is always an opportunity for companies to find a new route in business development or to rebrand your business in order to make it more flexible and open to time-sensitive needs. Whatever service or product you deal with, try not to ignore Brexit. Pretending that nothing has happened won’t work – take a look at your business, its peculiarities, and uniqueness. Think how you can understand your customers and business purposes more to make adjustments and find the best solution, even if you feel lost and uncertain.
