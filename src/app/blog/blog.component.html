        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-title">Simple booking.</span>
            Trip booking services are very convenient to use minimizing the time needed to plan the vocation or a
            business trip. Customers can book a trip any time they feel like from any place and get the immediate

            booking, tour planning and so on.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-title">Appealing content.</span>
            One more great advantage of the online booking is that a customer can use lots of various content like
            maps, videos, customers’ reviews or even virtual tours. This variation helps to persuade a user easily.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-title">Comparison feature.</span>
            As well as that, some services allow to compare prices, so a user believes that they make an informed
            choice with lots of benefits and with no filling that they spent more than they planned to. Especially it’s
            necessary for flight tickets booking as their prices can vary.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-title">Hot offers.</span>
            As a matter of fact, some customers are very impulsive and tend to make spur-of-the-moment purchases. And

            How to make your solution competitive
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Comparing the data from all over the world, we have to notice that the greatest proportion of the income is
            generated in Europe ($62 billion) then goes the USA ($60 billion) and China ($20 billion) in 2016. In
            Europe, the most travelling country is Great Britain. And if you have no idea where to start, you can
            easily choose Europe.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            However, don’t forget about the giants of this business like Expedia and Priceline Group, which offer
            all-in-one travel solutions, with flight tickets booking, hotel reservation, car rent and so on. They
            achieved it with the help of mediators consolidation, like Kayak, Booking, TripAdvisor and Hotels.com.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Now, you see that the market is rather competitive. In order not to drown you need to stand out from
            others. To do that, pay attention to these three main factors:
            <ul class="paragraph-list">

                <li>Technical innovations and innovative solutions</li>
                <li>Social hype around your project</li>

            1. Unique concept of your company.
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            It’s not a secret that there are lots of similar tours on the tourist service market every gives you a
            chance to book a hotel, plan your tour, buy flight tickets. Nevertheless, they also try to create some
            unique proposals, like “romantic tour” or “gastronome tour” where you can enjoy a private relaxed
            atmosphere with your soul-mate or try gastronomic specialities.
        </div>

            like unknown roots or eco-hotels. The hotels in your service may have yoga classes, adventurous events, ski
            holidays and various spa or vice versa services for families with kids. Religious tours gain popularity,
            why not to use it as a special offer, including monasteries and holy places in the itinerary.

            2. Technical innovations and innovative solutions
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The main factors that brought tourism industry to the global level were smartphones and online booking
            services. Smartphones allow customers to get immediate access to online-booking of various services via the
            mobile applications. And believe me, the leaders on the market are not standing still and keep up with
            technological innovations. They understand that it’s a key to their success, a way to advance their
            business and attract a new audience to their services.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            According to the recent Facebook Developer Conference, the trends in the technological sphere is chatbot
            implementation, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented and Virtual reality. And soon the implementation of
            these technologies will be an essential part of the majority of travel agencies.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Customers are thrilled with an idea to try VR tour before booking a trip or an accommodation. As well as
            that, virtual assistants and chatbots will make the booking process more personalized and automated.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Actually, there are many more innovative approaches which can be used in the travel industry, let’s look
            closer at them.
        </div>

        <h3 class="section-sub-title">
            2.1. Chatbot
        </h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Chatbot is a program that works perfectly with clients, as it creates a personalized approach and shortens
            the route to the action fulfilment. Even more, the program memorizes preferences and taste of a user. Some
            famous travel companies like Expedia.com, Kayak and Skyscanner launched their own bots on Facebook,
            Messenger and Slack. The bots help customers to book tickets, choose hotels and tours for their holidays.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Chatbots are an effective way to save on client support and improve their satisfaction. If you create a
            multilingual Chatbot with 24\7 client support, you will automate multiple routine tasks and reduce expenses
            on staff training.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            As an example, take a look at SnapTravel Chatbot, which combines Artificial intelligence and Machine
            Learning tools to perform a search on Expedia, Priceline and other partner sites to provide a customer with
            the best offer. At first, the Chatbot asks cities, date of a trip and your hotel and budget preferences.
            After that, it offers a few deals. Of course, the program doesn’t cover all offers on the market and a
            customer may have to wait for a few minutes until the answer arrives, yet the service is reliable and
            already has many loyal customers.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The other example is a Chatbot from Hello Hipmunk. It works on Facebook Messenger,  Slack and Skype.
            A customer can ask for advice where to go, when to go and even choose a type of a holiday, like romantic,
            adventure, bitch or gastronome. A User can even choose an airline company that he likes the most. Based on
            this information the Chatbot searches for the relevant offers. If a customer doesn’t want to talk to
            Chatbot, he can use standard site or application, which is rather sensible as not all users like chatting
            neither with a bot nor with a person-assistant.
        </div>

        <h3 class="section-sub-title">
            2.2. VR and AR
        </h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            We believe that AR and VR can fulfil two tasks in the tourism industry: demonstration and inspiration. The
            technologies can be used as a sales instrument and influence on a decision making process. VR can be used
            by:
            <ul class="paragraph-list">
                <li>
                    Airlines and railway companies to demonstrate airplane cabin, choose between classes (business or
                    first class)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hotels, to show different rooms, view and facilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Travel agencies, to show what tourist attractions are included in a tour, some special offers, like
                    diving or paragliding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Car rental companies, to offer all available vehicles and services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conference and exhibition centres.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            You may hear an opinion that it’s too complicated and too expensive but new technologies build the world we
            will live tomorrow, don’t lose a chance to be a part of the future. Photo and video not always give an
            overall idea of a place. Full-immersion is a new experience that may become a great marketing tool for your
            business.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Suppose a user is choosing a hotel, your mobile app offers a VR tour, so a customer can feel the
            atmosphere, the condition of a place and if something is wrong he can move to another VR tour.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            YouVisit is a great example of a platform that adapted VR tours for its purposes. They have a really
            impressive HD library of virtual tours. Using Google Cardboard for mobile phones viewers dive into virtual
            tours visiting cosy streets of Paris or sunny beaches of Bora Bora.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Hooper is a great app with lots of personalized offers. In the app, you can not only book flight tickets
            right from your handset but also recommend you the best time to do this. The app applies predictive
            analytics and finds the best offer according to the latest trends and price levels.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Don’t forget about Google Trips one more service to organize and plan trips. It automatically shows what
            places to visit during a day. If a user can’t find an interesting variant, he updates the result and the
            app shows what other spots near he can see. The standard feature to book a hotel is also available here.
            Moreover, the app works in online mode as well, so don’t worry if the Wi-Fi connection is poor.

            3. Create social hype around your project.
        </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Probably rumour mill is the best tool to advertise your project. And if you want everyone to know about
            your app, add there a few social features. For this, add city guide or a section with city events based on
            users advice. The section “Meeting” can also be helpful, here customers could arrange a meeting with other
            travellers to chat or have a cup of coffee. And the most important feature is social integration to share
            impressions with all friends.
